## Titanic Survival Analysis Project

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the factors influencing the likelihood of survival for Titanic passengers. The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, which resulted in the deaths of over a thousand people, provided an opportunity to explore data and apply various machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and make predictions.

### Project Description

This project aims to identify the characteristics of passengers that contributed to their survival. By applying data analysis techniques and classification models, I uncovered valuable insights into the relationship between demographic variables (such as age, gender, and ticket class) and survival outcomes.

### Goals

- **Survival Prediction**: Develop a model to predict the likelihood of passenger survival based on features in the dataset.
- **Category Analysis**: Analyze how factors such as gender, age, and ticket class influence survival rates.
- **Visualization of Findings**: Utilize visualizations to present the results of the analysis, such as graphs illustrating the relationship between demographic variables and survival.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use model evaluation techniques, including accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, to assess the performance of the applied models.

### Insight Dependencies

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Reveal patterns in the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships among variables affecting survival.
- **Inferential Statistics**: Employed to test hypotheses and draw conclusions based on the analyzed data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implement algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to predict passenger survival.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize Matplotlib and Seaborn to present analysis results in easily understandable graphical formats.

### Advice

- **Data Cleaning**: Pay attention to missing values or anomalies in the dataset to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
- **Variable Exploration**: Identify key variables that may influence survival, such as age, gender, and ticket class, before building the model.
- **Model Validation**: Employ cross-validation techniques to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy of the models used.
